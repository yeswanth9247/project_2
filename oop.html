								<h2>What Is Object-Oriented Programming?</h2>
								<p>Object-Oriented Programming(OOP), is all about creating “objects”.
									An object is a group of interrelated variables and functions.
									These variables are often referred to as properties of the object and functions
									are referred to as the behavior of the objects. These objects provide a better and
									clear structure for the program.

									<br><h3>For example</h3> A car can be an object. If we consider the car as an object then its
									properties would be – its color, its model, its price, its brand, etc.
									And its behavior/function would be acceleration, slowing down, gear change.</p>

								<h2>CLASS</h2>
								<ul>
								<li>A class is a collection of objects.  Unlike the primitive data structures,
									classes are data structures that the user defines.
									They make the code more manageable.</li>
								</ul>

								<h2>OBJECTS</h2>
								<ul>
								<li>Object is a bundle of data and its behaviour(often known as methods).</li>
								<li>An object, is an abstract data type. Objects can include
									multiple properties and methods and may even contain other objects.</li>
								</ul>

								<h2>INSTANTIATION</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>Instantiation is the creation of an object or an “instance” of a given class.
										By referencing a class declaration,
										an instantiated object is named and created, and stored in memory.</li>
								</ul>

								<h2>NAMESPACE</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>A namespace is a declarative region that provides
										a scope to the identifiers inside it.
										Namespaces are used to organize code into logical groups.
										In addition, namespaces prevent name collisions
										(when you want to reuse the same nameing for different classes or methods).</li>
								</ul>

								<h2>CONSTRUCTOR</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>A constructor is a special method of a class or structure that
										initializes a newly created object of that type.
										When the oject is created, the constructor is called automatically.</li>
								</ul>

								<h2>FIXTURE</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>A test fixture is a fixed state of a set of objects
										used as a baseline for running tests.
										The purpose of a test fixture is to ensure that there is a well known and
										fixed environment in which tests are run so that results are repeatable.</li>
								</ul>

								<h2>THE HINT</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>Type hinting means providing hints to function to only accept the given
										data type.</li>
										<li>In technical word we can say that Type Hinting is method by which we
										can force function to accept the desired data type.</li>
								</ul>

								<h2>TYPE CAST</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>Type casting is when you assign a value of one primitive data
										type to another type.</li>
								</ul>

								<h2>UNIT TEST</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>Unit testing are tests cases to cover all possible states and
										configurations of the software in order to discover bugs.</li>
								</ul>

								<h2>STATIC</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>Statics refer to static member variable, which is a "class variable"
										of a statically defined class. For example: a member variable of a
										given class which is shared across all instances aka objects,
										and is accessible as a member variable of these objects.</li>
								</ul>

								<h2>CLASS METHOD</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>An object is an element (or instance) of a class; objects have the
										behaviors of their class. The object is the actual component of programs,
										while the class specifies how instances are created and how they behave. method:
										a method is an action which an object is able to perform.</li>
								</ul>

								<h2>FACADE</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>Facade Method is a Structural Design pattern that provides a
										simpler unified interface to a more complex system. The word Facade means the
										face of a building or particularly an outer
										lying interface of a complex system, consists of several sub-systems.</li>
								</ul>

								<h2>DESIGN PATTERNS</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>Object-oriented design patterns typically show relationships and interactions
										between classes or objects, without specifying the final
										application classes or objects that are involved.
										Patterns that imply mutable state may be
										unsuited for functional programming languages.</li>
								</ul>

								<h2>METHOD</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>A method in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a procedure associated
										with a message and an object. An object consists of data and behavior;
										these comprise an interface,
										which specifies how the object may
										be utilized by any of its various consumers.</li>
								</ul>

								<h2>PROPERTY</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>A property, in some object-oriented programming languages,
										is a special sort of class member,
										intermediate in functionality between a field (or data member) and a method.</li>
								</ul>

								<h2>ENCAPSULATION</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>Wrapping data and the methods that work on
										data within one unit is called Encapsulation.</li>
									<li>Encapsulation puts restrictions on accessing variablesand
										methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data</li>
									<li>Basically all classes are example of an encapsulation as it
										encapsulates all the data that is member functions, variables etc.</li>
									<br>
									<h3>Private variable </h3>
									<p>An object’s variable can only be changed by an object’s method. this is
										to prevent accidental changes.The double underscore
										__ prefixed to a variable makes it private.</p>

									<h3>Public members </h3>
									<p>(Generally methods declared in a class) are accessible from outside the class.</p>

									<h3>Protected members </h3>
									<p>Those members of the class that cannot be accessed outside the class but can be
										accessed from within the class and its subclasses.
										Syntax for protected members uses prefixing the name of the
										member by a single underscore “_”.</p>

									<h2>ABSTRACTION</h2>
									<ul>
										<li>Abstraction is one of the OOP Concepts in Java which is an act of
											representing essential features without including background details.
											It is a technique of creating a new data type that is suited for a
											specific application. Lets understand this one of the OOPs Concepts
											with example, while driving a car, you do not have to
											be concerned with its internal working.
											Here you just need to concern about parts
											like steering wheel, Gears, accelerator, etc.</li>
										<li>Abstraction can be thought of as a natural extension of encapsulation.</li>
											<li>Abstraction means that each object only exposes a high-level
											mechanism for using it. All implementation details are hidden and only
											relevant operations are visiable to the objects that use them</li>
									</ul>

									<h2>INERITACE</h2>
									<ul>
										<li>Inheritance is when you create a (child) class by deriving from another
											(parent) class. Thus creating a hierarchy. The child class reuses all
											fields and methods of the parent class (common part)
											and can implement its own (unique part).</li>
										<li>Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit
											the properties from another class.</li>
										<li>Inheritance is one of the Basic Concepts of OOPs in which one object
											acquires the properties and behaviors of the parent object.
											It’s creating a parent-child relationship between two classes.
											It offers robust and natural mechanism for
											organizing and structure of any software.</li>
									</ul>

									<h2>POLYMORHISM</h2>
									<ul>
										<li>
											Polymorphism is when we have a parent class and a few child
											classes which inherit from it. This can be implemented
											A collection or list — which contains a mix of all these classes,
											or through a method implemented for the parent class.
										</li>
										<li>Polymorphism gives a way to use a class exactly
											like its parent so there is no confusion with mixing types.
											Each child class keeps its own methods as they are.</li>
										<li>Means the same function name (but different signatures)
											being used for different types.</li>
										<li>In-built example of polymorphism in Python - len() function can take
											String and List also which means same function
											name but different behaviour with respect
											to different parameters/signature.</li>
										<li>
											Polymorphism refers to one of the OOPs concepts in
											Java which is the ability of a variable, object or function to take on
											multiple forms. For example, in English, the verb run has a different
											meaning if you use it with a laptop, a foot race, and business.
											Here, we understand the meaning of
											run based on the other words used along with it.
											The same also applied to Polymorphism.
