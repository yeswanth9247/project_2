				<p>
					Object-oriented programming is a methodology for writing an organized, cohesive program. The core principles of
					OOP all imply a minimum level of organization in which to write a program. To exaggerate the point, you wouldn't
					keep your apples and your toolset in the same cabinet would you? You would keep the apples in the kitchen with
					the other fruits while your toolset would go in the garage with your other tools. Likewise, you wouldn't build
					a workshop in the kitchen and cook in the garage. In programming, this organization of like goes with like is
					what is known as the separation of concerns. Similar to encapsulation, a program should always strive to divide
					up work based on certain tasks.
				</p>
					<li>The Seperation of Concerns concept is used in the Calculator program in such a way that the class calculator
						is divided into seperate classes like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.</li>
					<li> The class calculation in the program Calculation has the declaration of the object and the variables and the class is used as a parameters to the other classes
						like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.</li>
					<li> The program Calculator_test is used to write the custom test cases for the calculator. </li>
					<li> The program Main is used to define the methods for the operations of the calculator.</li>
					<li> The program Addition is used to perform the addition operation.</li
					<li> The program Subtraction is used to perform the subtraction operation.</li>
					<li> The program Multiplication is used to perform the multiplication operation.</li>
					<li> The program Division is used to perform the division operation.</li>
					<li> THe program Calculator is used to declare the methods and print the end result of the calculator.</li>


				</ul>

				<br>
				<p>This stage of employer may additionally seem tedious or overemphasized. The importance, however, of a nicely-prepared and
					properly-written application can not be overstated. To supply a extra realistic instance, I'll seek advice from the calculator's report
					shape (shown above) that has been stated in preceding articles. While now not proven inside the preceding examples, pictured
					above is the record-structure of the calculator's code. Here, you may see a standard calculator file, with 2 documents
					within alongside a calculator.Py record and an __init__.Py report. Already, a trendy enterprise shape can
					be visible from the files. The calculator.Py report is the primary document in which all of the paintings comes collectively. Further, a
					calculations folder and a records folder can be discovered inner, where the calculations' folder is in fee of the
					math element of the calculator and the history folder is in price of the lesser capability of the calculator.
					This separation of challenge is beneficial mainly for reusing code. Say you are writing every other software with
					calculator functionality. Instead of getting to parse through disorganized documents and refactor code, you'll be
					capable of reproduction and paste the existing folders into your new initiatives, and with small tweaks for your code, you would
					be capable of copy and paste your calculator in a totally extraordinary challenge.</p>

				<h3>SEPERATION OF CONCERN IN CALCULATOR PROGRAM</h3>
				<p>
					SOC is used in the Calculator Program such that the program is broken into distinct features
					that overlap in functionality as little as possible. We have broken the original problem
					of creating a Calculator to perform Addition into four independent tasks:
				</p>
				<img src="images/i16.png"  height="450" width="600" />
				<br>
				<img src="images/i17.png"  height="300" width="600" />
				<br>
				<img src="images/i19.png"  height="200" width="600" />
				<br>
				<img src="images/i18.png"  height="150" width="600" />
				<p>
					In all the above four, all the classes have been
					separated by function, the get_result is first defined in a different class Calculation and then gives us the result of the addition, the add_calculation adds the calculation to history
					and the add_numbers function calls the other two functions together to finally create the proper calculator
					functionality. The four separate classes come together to form the Calculator program, but each action or concern				</p>
